# BotBrawler
*"Robots Activate"*

Designed to be a way to simulate robot battles, Bot Brawler is a companion application aimed to be a go-to staple for the pinnacle of robot combat.

The official live version can currently be found [here](https://valquaint.reisama.net)

### Approach

Utilizing a built-in express server to provide a lightweight API, and MongoDB, Bot Brawler provides a fast and simple way to keep track of robot statistics throughout a fighter's career. It also provides a raw endpoint for exporting data into other applications or uses.

The simple designs presented in EJS keep the layout crisp and easy to follow without bloating the page, while also keeping it fast to load on mobile. 

### Planned Features

Bot Brawler will eventually be able to simulate fights against bots, as well as simulate tournament brackets. These will be simulated using various algorithms and options to choose from, including using raw win/loss data, or advanced simulation data.
